###Chris Salter Reading Response 

In Chris Salter, Entangled we explore the work of German composer turned architect Richard Wagner who was the pioneer who 
Strategically created a theatre for the audience to maintain audience focus for the duration of the fifteen-hour opera Der Ring Des Nibelungen. The goal of the space was for the audience to consume all the artwork that was being presented which is known as "Gesamtkunstwerk." The construction of the space gained notoriety in his career, although it wasn't a groundbreaking success many architects in the future took after his inspirations which were to create spaces that will "include all phases of art and in doing so to consume, to destroy each one, to speak, in favor of the total purpose of them all" this was the core basis of Wagner developing the space.
     
After Wagner died his work as a composer was less influential to the public eye, it was spoiled by his clunky design, particularly in the use of pseudonaturalistic flat, pictorial representations that contradicted the symbolic and sonorous intensity of Wagner's unparalleled musical extraction. "Appita tried to succeed where Wagner failed by creating his centric interpretations through using physical contemporary tools. This was done by building his artistic framework by creating pseudo illuminations created by " two-dimensional, painting based representation toward spatial arrangments of abstracted, rhythm forms." Appia and Wagner both showed and developed their own contemporary tools for the audience's attention and satisfaction with their musical shows. 

Like Wagner, Appia showed there are ways to use contemporary tools to make them considered to be "Gesamtkunstwerk". But the ways they did this were mainly physical until the start of World War I. World War I introduced an amplitude of technologies for the war this technology was later used to make art. The most notable technology is the manipulation of light. Today we can use light to create both 2D and 3D objects. This chapter expanded the knowledge of art and architecture and how "Gesamtkunstwerk" can even be communicated from the design of rows and columns of an opera building.
